# PHP and [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) based database


## Getting started ! 🚀

### Why? 🙄

If you want to build a simple webiste with a backend.

The **simplest** and **convenient** way of doing this, considering if you don't want to setup any database 
and not going to scale too much. It stores data objects in collections and documents. <br/>

The webpage works on both mobile web browsers & desktop.

### Requirements

* Hosting server must support **PHP**

### How to use
Download ZIP with latest version from master branch.<br/>
Just copy the files to your webspace - thats all :)

**Default password: admin123**

<br/>


### Limitations ☹

**Lack some of the features that traditional databases offer, such as**

* indexing
* querying
* transactions
* concurrent access by multiple users (solved to an extent by `flock()` function)
* etc..

<br/>
In summary, using CSV files as a database for a website can work for simple and small-scale projects, but it may not be the best option for larger and more complex applications 😄.
